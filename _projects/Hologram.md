In this project, our team aimed to create a floating 3D display using minimal equipment. Inspired by [Pepperâ€™s Cone](https://doi.org/10.1145/3126594.3126602), which leverages the Pepper's Ghost illusion, we extended its capabilities to develop an interactive device. Viewers can interact with the technology through a joystick to adjust the image angle and a button to switch between pictures. Additionally, we deployed the software as a web page for cross-platform accessibility.
