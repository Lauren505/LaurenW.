My team created a 3D display that appears to float in mid-air using simple equipment. To accomplish this, we studied ["Pepper's Cone"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3126594.3126602), which utilized the Pepper's Ghost illusion, and expanded its potential to create a multimedia interactive device. Viewers can engage with the technology by using a joystick to adjust the image angle and a button to change between pictures. Moreover, we deployed the software as a web page to enable cross-platform use.
