In the final project of the EECS Cornerstone course, we transformed a remote control car into a smart wheelchair with the aim of aiding individuals with mobility impairments, offering them enhanced control and independence. To achieve this, we implemented gesture control by designing a glove equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and a Lilypad, allowing users to control the wheelchair's direction through hand gestures. An ultrasonic module at the front of the vehicle automatically detects obstacles for hazard avoidance. The integration of a WiFi module facilitates the transmission of sensed information to a cloud platform, connected to communication software that enables caregivers to monitor the user's location. Our project earned us first place in the final competition.
