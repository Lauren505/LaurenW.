Our goal is to help people with mobility impairments control their wheelchairs with ease and independence, without relying on assistance from others. Therefore, we want to create a wheelchair that can be controlled through gestures. We simulated a smart wheelchair by retrofitting a remote control car with a three-axis accelerometer, allowing users to control the direction of the wheelchair through hand gestures. We installed an ultrasonic module at the front of the vehicle to automatically detect obstacles and avoid danger. We used a WiFi module to transmit the information sensed on the vehicle to a cloud platform and linked it to communication software, allowing caregivers to keep track of the user's whereabouts.
Our innovation was recognized with first place in a student competition.
