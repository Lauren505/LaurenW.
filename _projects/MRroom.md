During my time in Ithaca, waking up to the sunlight filtering through my window and catching glimpses of the hillside forest has become a cherished memory I wish to preserve. Knowing I would have to leave this town in a week, I decided to create a digital replica of my room, a place I could revisit at any time.

To build the space, I came across an app called Magicplan, which enabled me to gauge the dimensions of my apartment using my smartphone camera. With the floor plan and a 3D model of the apartment walls generated, I proceeded to create 3D models of other objects, refining measurements along the way.

The only task remaining was to import this 3D model into Unity. I utilized a VR scene I had set up, incorporating interactive objects with the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit. After some calibration, I can now navigate the virtual environment without colliding with walls and have a digital version of my apartment accessible from anywhere.
