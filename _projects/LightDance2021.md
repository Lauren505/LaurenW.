The "Light Dance" show is an event put together by students at NTUEE, showcasing a combination of technology and dance. The performance is well-known for its impressive use of lighting effects as well as the custom-made hardware and software that bring it to life. This annual production takes place at Yi-Ren Hall at NTU during the Night of Electrical Engineering and draws audiences from beyond its campus borders. In addition to this main event, the crew also performed at other notable occasions such as the NTU Arts Festival and the 2020 VLSI Design/CAD Symposium.

My contributions in 2021 included designing the light sword and repairing and maintaining the hardware package for each dancer. The product design experience of the light sword allowed me to acquire hands-on experience with 3D printing and laser-cutting technologies as well as utilizing LED strips and other materials to produce desired lighting effects. Moreover, through fixing and upkeeping the hardware components, I enhanced my comprehension of how electrical engineering knowledge can be implemented in practical applications.
