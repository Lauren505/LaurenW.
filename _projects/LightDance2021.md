The "Light Dance" show is an event put together by students at NTUEE, showcasing a combination of technology and dance. The performance is well-known for its mesmerizing lighting effects as well as the custom-made hardware and software. Held annually at Yi-Ren Hall during the Night of Electrical Engineering, the performance extends its appeal beyond the campus borders. Noteworthy appearances include the NTU Arts Festival and the 2020 VLSI Design/CAD Symposium.

My contributions in 2021 included designing the light sword and repairing and maintaining the hardware packages for dancers. The product design experience of the light sword allowed me to acquire hands-on experience with 3D printing and laser-cutting technologies as well as utilizing LED strips and other materials to produce desired lighting effects. Moreover, through fixing and upkeeping the hardware components, I enhanced my comprehension of how electrical engineering knowledge can be implemented in practical applications.
