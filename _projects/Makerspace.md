In July 2021, I co-directed the Academic Branch of the NTUEE Student Association. One of our main responsibilities is to run the Makerspace that provide students access to tools and equipment for creative projects and hands-on making experiences. This year, we relocated the old Makerspace to the new department building, reconstructed the space, and upgraded our equipment to support a broader range of projects.

The Makerspace serves as an innovative hub for students to explore and experiment with technology, design, and creativity. We organized workshops covering topics such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and SBCs, and arranged talks featuring alumni and industry professionals.
