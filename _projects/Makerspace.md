In July 2021, I took on the role of Academic Director for the NTUEE Student Association. One of the main goals for the academic branch is to run a Makerspace that will provide students with access to tools and equipment for creative projects and hands-on making experiences. That year, we relocated the old Makerspace to the new department building, reconstructed the space, and upgraded our equipment to facilitate a more diverse range of projects.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/makerspace2.jpg" title="makerspace2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Our Makerspace serves as an innovative hub for students to explore and experiment with technology, design, and creativity. We hold workshops on topics such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and SBCs and host talks by alumni and industry professionals to inspire fellow students with valuable insights.
