One of my current research endeavors involves an exploration of the human palm's ability to perceive airflow directionality. To facilitate this investigation, I created experimental equipment that is capable of four degrees-of-freedom motion, including translational movement along both x and y axes as well as yaw and pitch rotation. The apparatus was assembled using a 3D printer kit in conjunction with two servo motors, while two laser modules were affixed to distinguish the focal point location on the palm.
