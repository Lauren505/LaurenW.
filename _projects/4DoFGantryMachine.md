One of my research projects delves into human perception, particularly focusing on the palm's capacity to perceive airflow directionality. To conduct a thorough user study and ensure robust results, I developed specialized equipment capable of 4DoF motion. This includes translational movement along both the x and y axes, as well as yaw and pitch rotation. To build this apparatus, I repurposed a 3D printer kit, adding two servo motors and two laser modules to pinpoint the focal point location on the palm.
