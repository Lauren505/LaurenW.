This Unity game is a group project for the Game Design course. We drew inspiration from the horror game Dark Echo, where players navigate dangerous environments using visualized sound bouncing off obstacles to reveal the shape of the surrounding world.

In our game, we elevated this concept by making the environment and soundwaves 3-dimensional. With each step, players observe soundwaves emanating from their footprints, creating a dynamic visual representation of the 3D world. These waves extend throughout the environment, guiding players as they explore their path. The objective is to collect all four gemstones and place them on the central altar.
