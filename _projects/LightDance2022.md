In 2022, I led the Light Dance team and was responsible for overseeing the design, fabrication, programming, and maintenance of all hardware and software components. Over 50 people participated in the production and I learned so much from them. Without any single member, our success would not have been possible.

The hardware team designed circuit architecture, conducted welding assembly and performance measurement, and handled post-maintenance tasks. The software team wrote customized lighting software, supporting wireless control of the lighting effect and real-time display functions, as well as remote connections and synchronization during the performance. The prop team created remarkable props, utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, and woodworking techniques, with integrated lighting control. The costume team fastened LED lights and wires onto fabrics and brought the glow-in-the-dark suits to life.

This year, we renovated the performance by replacing EL wires with optical fibers to enable color-changing effects. In addition, we put effort into hardware modularization, improved hardware stability, and established a foundation and standard for future performances. On the software side, we have added collaborative editing functionality and a 3D editing interface to the lighting software for a better and more streamlined experience.
