In 2022, I led the NTUEE Light Dance team, where we designed, fabricated, and programmed all the hardware and software components to bring to life this glow-in-the-dark performance.

The hardware team designed the circuit, assembled the components, oversaw system performance, and promptly addressed any necessary repairs. The software team developed a customized software, supporting wireless control of lighting effects, real-time display functions, as well as remote connections and synchronization during the performance. The prop team leveraged their expertise in 3D printing, laser cutting, and woodworking to craft staggering stage props. The costume team secured electronic modules, light sources, wires, and fibers integrated into fabrics, bringing the suits to life.

This year, we renovated the performance by replacing EL wires with optical fibers to enable color-changing effects. Additionally, we put effort into hardware modularization, improved stability and established a foundation for future performances. On the software side, we added collaborative editing functions and a 3D editing interface to the lighting software for a better and more streamlined experience.
