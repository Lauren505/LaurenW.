I am a senior undergraduate student studying [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/). I am working at the HCI lab advised by Prof. [Mike Chen](https://mikechen.com/). My research interests include perception, haptics, and VR/MR technology. I am fortunate to be awarded the [Grace Hopper Scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/) and be supported by the Yu-Lin Scholarship. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, baking, and crafting things.
