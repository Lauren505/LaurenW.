I am a senior undergrad majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), advised by [Prof. Mike Chen](https://mikechen.com/) in the HCI Lab. Currently, I am working as a research intern at Cornell [Hybrid Body Lab](https://www.hybridbody.human.cornell.edu/) with [Prof. Cindy (Hsin-Liu) Kao](https://www.hybridbody.human.cornell.edu/cindyhlkao). <br/>
<br/>
My research spans VR/AR, haptics, perception, and displays, with a focus on creating immersive experiences that blend virtuality and reality. I am grateful for the [Grace Hopper Scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/) and the Yu-Lin Scholarship support. <br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I enjoy drawing, baking, and 3D modeling :)
